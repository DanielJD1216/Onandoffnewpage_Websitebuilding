## 🔴 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Email Integration (2-3 hours, HIGHEST IMPACT)

The consultation form is fully functional and accessible, but missing email confirmations. This is the #1 feature needed for business value.

### 1. Set up Resend API Configuration
```bash
# Verify Resend is installed
npm list resend @react-email/components @react-email/render

# If missing, install
npm install resend @react-email/components @react-email/render

# Verify environment variable
echo "Checking RESEND_API_KEY environment variable..."
```

### 2. Create Email Templates (Korean-First)
**Create:** `src/emails/consultation-confirmation.tsx`
```bash
mkdir -p src/emails
touch src/emails/consultation-confirmation.tsx
touch src/emails/consultation-confirmation-en.tsx
```

**Template Requirements:**
- Korean-primary with English fallback
- Professional On & Off New Page branding
- Include consultation details (date, time, type)
- Generate .ics calendar attachment
- Mobile-responsive email design

### 3. Update Server Actions
**File:** `src/lib/actions/consultation.ts`

**Add to existing `submitConsultationBooking` function:**
```typescript
// After successful form submission, add:
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { ConsultationConfirmation } from '@/emails/consultation-confirmation';

// Send confirmation email
// Generate .ics calendar file
// Handle email errors gracefully
// Return success/error status to UI
```

**Expected Time:** 2-3 hours
