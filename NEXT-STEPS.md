## 🔴 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Email Integration (2-3 hours, HIGHEST IMPACT)

The consultation form is fully functional and accessible, but missing email confirmations. This is the #1 feature needed for business value.

### 1. Set up Resend API Configuration
```bash
# Verify Resend is installed
npm list resend @react-email/components @react-email/render

# If missing, install
npm install resend @react-email/components @react-email/render

# Verify environment variable
echo "Checking RESEND_API_KEY environment variable..."
```

### 2. Create Email Templates (Korean-First)
**Create:** `src/emails/consultation-confirmation.tsx`
```bash
mkdir -p src/emails
touch src/emails/consultation-confirmation.tsx
touch src/emails/consultation-confirmation-en.tsx
```

**Template Requirements:**
- Korean-primary with English fallback
- Professional On & Off New Page branding
- Include consultation details (date, time, type)
- Generate .ics calendar attachment
- Mobile-responsive email design

### 3. Update Server Actions
**File:** `src/lib/actions/consultation.ts`

**Add to existing `submitConsultationBooking` function:**
```typescript
// After successful form submission, add:
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { ConsultationConfirmation } from '@/emails/consultation-confirmation';

// Send confirmation email
// Generate .ics calendar file
// Handle email errors gracefully
// Return success/error status to UI
```

**Expected Time:** 2-3 hours

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY: Content Enhancement (3-4 hours)

Technical foundation is solid. Now focus on compelling Korean-market content.

### 1. Homepage Hero Section Enhancement
**File:** `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`

**Current:** Basic structure exists
**Needed:**
- Compelling value proposition for Korean parents
- Trust indicators (Vancouver office, years of experience)
- Clear differentiation (independent vs parent-accompanied services)
- Parent testimonial integration
- Strong call-to-action buttons

**Example Korean Value Proposition:**
- "캐나다 밴쿠버 현지 사무소에서 직접 관리하는 유학 전문 서비스"
- "11-18세 자녀를 위한 맞춤형 유학 컨설팅"

### 2. Services Page Detailed Content
**File:** `src/app/[locale]/services/page.tsx`

**Currently:** Structure in place, content needed
**Add:**
- Service comparison table (Independent vs Parent-Accompanied)
- Step-by-step process flow with timelines
- Transparent pricing structure in CAD
- FAQ section addressing common Korean parent concerns
- Success rate statistics and guarantees

### 3. Contact Information Verification
**Files to check:**
- Verify Vancouver office address consistency
- Ensure KakaoTalk integration is properly linked
- Update business hours (PST/KST timezone display)
- Add emergency contact information

**Expected Time:** 3-4 hours

- src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx

```

### 2. Performance Optimization

```

### 3. Code Cleanup (Optional)
```bash
# Fix ESLint warnings (non-blocking)
npm run lint

# Focus on these files if time permits:

```

**Expected Time:** 1-2 hours
