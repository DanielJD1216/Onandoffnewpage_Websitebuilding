### **Walnut Grove Secondary**

* **District:** Langley School District (SD35)
* **Programs:** Advanced Placement (AP)
* **Strengths:** Strong AP program (math, sciences, English, etc.) + large course offerings
* **Key Features:**

  * Wide range of AP courses (including sciences)
  * Modern facilities, including science labs
  * Support for international students available through the district

*(I’d remove “science specialization” since it’s not an official designation, but keep the AP + science strength theme.)*

* **Strengths:** Variety of electives, practical/hands-on courses
* **Key Features:**

  * AP exam opportunities

* **District:** Surrey School District (SD36)
* **Programs:** Wide course offerings
* **Strengths:** Large, comprehensive secondary school
* **Key Features:**

  * Strong athletics and extracurriculars

*(I’d soften “arts-focused” since Tweedsmuir is more of a large, general school. It’s not known as an arts magnet like Langley Fine Arts.)*
