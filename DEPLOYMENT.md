# Deployment Guide - On & Off Study Abroad Website

This guide explains how to deploy the website to production. We recommend **Vercel** as it's the easiest and has excellent Next.js support.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure:
- âœ… The website works locally (`npm run dev`)
- âœ… All environment variables are set up
- âœ… You have access to the GitHub repository
- âœ… You have a custom domain (optional, can use free Vercel domain)

## Recommended: Deploy to Vercel

Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and offers the best experience.

### Why Vercel?

- âœ… **Free tier** is generous (perfect for this site)
- âœ… **Automatic deployments** from GitHub
- âœ… **Built-in CDN** for fast global access
- âœ… **Easy environment variables** management
- âœ… **Automatic HTTPS** certificates
- âœ… **Zero configuration** needed for Next.js

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Push Code to GitHub

```bash
cd MAIN

# Make sure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Create Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. **Sign up with GitHub** (recommended - makes deployment easier)

#### 3. Import Your Project

1. After signing in, click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
2. Select "Import Git Repository"
3. Find your repository and click "Import"
4. Vercel will auto-detect it's a Next.js project

#### 4. Configure Project Settings

**Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
**Root Directory**: `./MAIN` (or leave as `.` if the repo root is MAIN)
**Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-filled)
**Output Directory**: `.next` (auto-filled)

Click "Deploy" - but it will fail because environment variables aren't set yet!

#### 5. Add Environment Variables

1. Go to your project settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add **all** variables from your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGci...

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # Use LIVE keys for production!
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...

# Resend
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com  # Your actual domain

# Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**Important**:
- Use **production** (live) keys for Stripe, not test keys
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your actual domain
- Select "Production" environment for all variables

#### 6. Redeploy

After adding environment variables:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click the three dots (...) on the latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache" unchecked
5. Click "Redeploy"

Your site should now deploy successfully!

#### 7. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain like `onoffstudyabroad.com`:

1. Go to your project â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Enter your domain name
3. Vercel will show you DNS records to add
4. Go to your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
5. Add the DNS records Vercel shows you
6. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS to propagate
7. Vercel will automatically provision SSL certificate

**Free Vercel Domain**: If you don't have a domain, you can use the free one: `your-project.vercel.app`

#### 8. Update Service Configurations

Now that you have a production URL, update these services:

**Supabase**:
1. Go to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
2. Add your production URL: `https://yourdomain.com`
3. Add callback URLs:
   - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`
   - `https://yourdomain.com/en/auth/callback`
   - `https://yourdomain.com/ko/auth/callback`

**Stripe**:
1. Switch to "Live mode" (toggle in top right)
2. Go to Developers â†’ Webhooks
3. Add new endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
5. Copy the new webhook secret
6. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel environment variables
7. Redeploy

**Resend**:
1. Verify your domain for email sending
2. Update "From" email addresses to use your domain

### Automatic Deployments

Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:
- Push to `main` branch â†’ Deploys to production
- Push to other branches â†’ Creates preview deployment

## Alternative: Deploy to Netlify

Netlify is another great option, similar to Vercel.

### Step-by-Step for Netlify

#### 1. Create Netlify Account

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub

#### 2. Create New Site

1. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
2. Choose GitHub and select your repository
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Base directory**: `MAIN` (if needed)
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `.next`

#### 3. Add Environment Variables

Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables and add all your `.env.local` variables.

#### 4. Configure Next.js

Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

#### 5. Deploy

Commit and push the `netlify.toml` file. Netlify will automatically deploy.

## Monitoring After Deployment

### 1. Set Up Error Tracking (Optional but Recommended)

Use Vercel's built-in analytics or add Sentry:

```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

### 2. Monitor Performance

- Use Vercel Analytics (free, built-in)
- Or Google Analytics (if you added the GA_MEASUREMENT_ID)

### 3. Check Logs

View logs in Vercel dashboard:
- Go to your project â†’ Logs
- Filter by errors
- Check for any issues after deployment

## Updating the Live Site

### Method 1: Automatic (Recommended)

Just push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push origin main
```

Vercel automatically detects the push and redeploys (takes 2-3 minutes).

### Method 2: Manual Redeploy

In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Click "..." on any deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"

## Rollback to Previous Version

If something breaks:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard â†’ Deployments
2. Find a working previous deployment
3. Click "..." â†’ "Promote to Production"

Your site instantly reverts to that version!

## Common Deployment Issues

### Build fails with "Module not found"

**Solution**: Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`, not just `devDependencies`.

```bash
# Move a package from devDependencies to dependencies
npm install package-name --save
```

### Environment variables not working

**Solution**:
1. Check spelling and values in Vercel
2. Make sure you selected "Production" environment
3. Redeploy after adding variables

### Images not loading

**Solution**: Check `next.config.js` has correct image domains:

```javascript
images: {
  domains: ['yourdomain.com', 'supabase.co'],
}
```

### Stripe webhooks failing

**Solution**:
1. Make sure webhook URL is exactly: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
2. Copy the webhook secret from Stripe live mode
3. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel
4. Redeploy

### 404 errors on page refresh

**Solution**: This shouldn't happen with Vercel, but if it does:
- Check your `next.config.js` configuration
- Make sure Vercel is set to "Next.js" framework preset
